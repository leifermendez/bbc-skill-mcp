# BBC MCP Tool v2.0 — Safe-by-Default WhatsApp Bot Builder

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

v2.0 = v1 + Safety. Same tools, same BBC API, but with **mandatory patterns** that prevent
the silent failures, accidental deletions, and unvalidated deploys that plagued v1.

**Three pillars:**
1. **VERIFY** — After every mutating operation, call the corresponding `list_*` to confirm
2. **GATE** — Before every destructive operation, show impact and require explicit "yes"
3. **RECOVER** — When something fails, diagnose why and propose a fix, never just stop

---

## TOOL REFERENCE (Quick)

| Tool | Purpose | Mutating? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `builderbot_list_projects` | List all projects | No |
| `builderbot_create_project` | Create project | Yes |
| `builderbot_list_flows` | List flows in project | No |
| `builderbot_create_flow` | Create flow with keywords | Yes |
| `builderbot_update_flow` | Update flow config | Yes |
| `builderbot_delete_flow` | Delete flow + all answers | Yes (DESTRUCTIVE) |
| `builderbot_list_answers` | List answers in flow | No |
| `builderbot_create_answer` | Add answer to flow | Yes |
| `builderbot_update_answer` | Update answer content | Yes |
| `builderbot_delete_answer` | Delete single answer | Yes (DESTRUCTIVE) |
| `builderbot_validate_bot` | Health check before deploy | No |
| `builderbot_deploy` | Deploy/status/QR/reboot/delete | Yes (some actions) |

---

## MANDATORY PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: VERIFY after every mutation

After ANY create/update/delete, call the corresponding `list_*` tool to confirm:

```
create_flow(projectId, ...) → list_flows(projectId) → search for the new flow
create_answer(...)          → list_answers(projectId, flowId) → search for new answer
update_answer(...)          → list_answers(projectId, flowId) → confirm content changed
delete_flow(...)            → list_flows(projectId) → confirm flow is gone
```

If verification fails: STOP, report the discrepancy, diagnose, and propose recovery.

### Pattern 2: GATE before destructive actions

Before `delete_flow`, `delete_answer`, or `deploy(action='delete')`:

1. Show what will be affected (flow name, answer count, references)
2. Show a clear warning: "⚠️ This cannot be undone"
3. Wait for explicit user confirmation
4. After execution, VERIFY the deletion
5. Run `validate_bot` to check for broken references

### Pattern 3: RECOVER on failure

When any operation fails or verification shows a discrepancy:

1. **Diagnose**: Check limits (flow count), conflicts (duplicate keywords), permissions
2. **Report**: Tell user exactly what went wrong
3. **Propose**: Offer concrete fix (delete unused flow, rename keyword, retry)
4. **Execute**: Fix with user approval, then VERIFY

## FLOW CREATION RULES

### create_flow parameters

```
projectId:        UUID (from list_projects)
name:             "Human Readable Name" (Title Case, user's language)
label:            "snake_case_slug" (lowercase, no spaces)
keywords:         ["keyword1", "keyword2"] or ["EVENTS.WELCOME"]
listenKeywords:   false (ALWAYS false unless EVENTS.VOICE_NOTE)
transcribeAudio:  true only for EVENTS.VOICE_NOTE
interpretImage:   true only for EVENTS.MEDIA
analyzeDocument:  true only for EVENTS.DOCUMENT
```

### CRITICAL RULES

- `listenKeywords` MUST be `false` for ALL flows EXCEPT `EVENTS.VOICE_NOTE`
- A new flow has 0 answers — the bot will NOT respond until you add answers
- Always add answers IMMEDIATELY after creating a flow
- Text keywords must be UNIQUE across all flows
- System events (EVENTS.*) must not be mixed with text keywords
- Each EVENTS.* can appear in only ONE flow

### System Events Reference

| Event | Use case | Required flags |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `EVENTS.WELCOME` | Catch-all / fallback | listenKeywords: false |
| `EVENTS.VOICE_NOTE` | Voice message handler | listenKeywords: true, transcribeAudio: true |
| `EVENTS.MEDIA` | Image handler | interpretImage: true |
| `EVENTS.DOCUMENT` | Document handler | analyzeDocument: true |
| `EVENTS.LOCATION` | Location shared | — |
| `EVENTS.ACTION` | Button/list response | — |

## ANSWER TYPES REFERENCE

### add_text — Simple text message
```
type: "add_text"
message: "Your text here"  ← MAX 160 chars for WhatsApp
```

### add_chatpdf — AI-powered assistant (Pattern 2)
```
type: "add_chatpdf"
message: ""  ← MUST be empty string
```
**CRITICAL**: NEVER mix `add_chatpdf` with `add_text` in the same flow.
Both fire on every message → broken double-response loop.
A flow with `add_chatpdf` must contain ONLY the `add_chatpdf` answer.

After creating, configure via `update_answer` with `assistant` field:
```
assistant: {
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant for [business]...",
  model: "gpt-5.4-nano"  (optional)
}
```

### add_image / add_video / add_doc / add_voice_note — Media
```
type: "add_image"
message: ""
options: { media: { url: "https://public-url.com/image.jpg" }, gotoFlow: {} }
```

### add_http — HTTP webhook/API call
```
type: "add_http"
message: ""
plugins: {
  http: {
    url: "https://api.example.com/endpoint",
    method: "GET" | "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },  // optional
    body: { key: "value" },  // optional, for POST
    rules: []  // REQUIRED — always include, even if empty
  }
}
```
**CRITICAL**: `plugins.http.rules` is REQUIRED. Omitting it causes backend rejection.

### add_mute — Mute contact (human handoff)
```
type: "add_mute"
plugins: { mute: { status: true, gapTime: 60 } }
options: { gotoFlow: { flowId: "farewell-flow-uuid" } }
```
Mutes the INDIVIDUAL contact, not the whole bot. `gapTime` = minutes until auto-unmute.

### add_intent — AI semantic routing
```
type: "add_intent"
plugins: {
  intent: {
    rules: [{
      conditionRule: "The user wants to talk to a human",
      conditionFlowId: "<target-flow-uuid>",
      condition: "",
      conditionValue: ""
    }]
  }
}
```

### Capture rule
`options.capture = true` → bot waits for user reply, passes it to NEXT answer.
**NEVER set capture=true on the LAST answer** of a flow — value is silently lost.

### Redirect
`options.gotoFlow = { flowId: "<target-flow-uuid>" }` → redirect after this answer.

## DECISION TREE: Which Pattern to Use

```
User request → What type of business?
├── Needs appointments/citas/availability → Pattern 2 (AI) ★ RECOMMENDED
├── Needs Q&A about products/services    → Pattern 2 (AI)
├── Needs order tracking/status          → Pattern 2 (AI) + HTTP
├── Simple info (hours, location, menu)  → Pattern 1 (keyword-based) OK
├── Lead generation / qualification      → Pattern 2 (AI) + capture
└── Human handoff / escalation           → Pattern 2 (AI) + mute
```

**DEFAULT**: Pattern 2 (AI-powered with `add_chatpdf`) for 80% of real cases.
Only use pure keyword → text flows for very simple, static information.

---

## PATTERN TEMPLATES BY VERTICAL

### Salon / Beauty / Services
- WELCOME: `add_chatpdf` with instructions about services, prices, availability
- AI instructions must include: services list, hours, booking guidance, escalation trigger
- Escalation flow: `add_mute` + human handoff
- Knowledge base: scrape website with `assistant.scrapeUrl`

### Restaurant / Food
- WELCOME: `add_chatpdf` with menu, hours, delivery info
- Order flow: capture address + items via AI
- Location flow: `add_text` with Google Maps link

### E-commerce / Store
- WELCOME: `add_chatpdf` with catalog, pricing, shipping
- Order status: `add_http` to check order API
- Support escalation: `add_mute`

### Content Creator / Digital Products
- WELCOME: `add_chatpdf` with product catalog, pricing
- Purchase flow: redirect to payment link
- Support: AI handles FAQ, escalates complex issues

### Forum / Event
- WELCOME: `add_chatpdf` with event details, schedule, registration
- Registration: capture data + `add_http` to registration API

## COMPLETE WORKFLOW: Building a Bot

### Step 1: Get or Create Project

```
list_projects()
├── Project exists → use its projectId
└── Need new → create_project(name) → list_projects() → VERIFY
```

### Step 2: Plan Flows

Before creating anything, plan all flows and share the plan with user:
```
📋 Bot Plan: [Business Name]
├── welcome (EVENTS.WELCOME) — AI assistant with business context
├── escalation (keyword: "agente", "humano") — Human handoff
├── [additional flows based on business needs]
└── Total: N flows
```

### Step 3: Create Flows (one at a time)

For EACH flow:
```
1. create_flow(projectId, name, label, keywords, ...)
2. list_flows(projectId) → VERIFY flow exists, get flow_id
3. create_answer(projectId, flowId, type, message, ...)
4. list_answers(projectId, flowId) → VERIFY answer exists
5. [If add_chatpdf] update_answer(answerId, assistant: { instructions: "..." })
6. list_answers(projectId, flowId) → VERIFY instructions set
```

**NEVER create all flows first then add answers. Create flow → add answers → verify → next flow.**

### Step 4: Validate

```
validate_bot(projectId)
├── criticalCount = 0 → Ready to deploy
└── criticalCount > 0 → Fix issues first
    ├── Dead ends → add answers to empty flows
    ├── Long messages → shorten to ≤160 chars
    ├── Dangling capture → remove capture from last answer
    └── Missing WELCOME → create welcome flow
```

### Step 5: Deploy (with GATE)

```
1. validate_bot(projectId) → MUST pass (criticalCount = 0)
2. Show deployment summary to user:
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 📤 DEPLOY SUMMARY          │
   │ Project: [name]            │
   │ Flows: N                    │
   │ Answers: M                  │
   │ Validation: ✅ PASS        │
   │ Confirm? [yes/no]          │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. deploy(projectId, action: "create")
5. deploy(projectId, action: "status") → check status
6. If READY_TO_SCAN → deploy(projectId, action: "qr") → show QR
```

## ERROR HANDLING FRAMEWORK

### Common Failures & Recovery

| Error | Diagnosis | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Flow created but not in list | Silent failure / API lag | Retry create, verify again |
| "Limit reached" | 50/50 flows used | List flows, find unused, offer to delete |
| Duplicate keyword | Keyword conflict | list_flows to find conflict, rename |
| Answer > 160 chars | WhatsApp truncation | Shorten message, verify |
| Deploy fails | Validation issues | Run validate_bot, fix all criticals |
| add_chatpdf + add_text in same flow | Double-response bug | Delete the add_text answer |
| capture=true on last answer | Dangling capture | Remove capture or add follow-up answer |

### Batch Operations: Sequential with Verification

When creating multiple flows, ALWAYS do them sequentially:
```
FOR EACH flow in plan:
  1. create_flow → VERIFY
  2. create_answer(s) → VERIFY each
  3. [configure AI if needed] → VERIFY
  THEN next flow
```

NEVER batch-create all flows then batch-add answers. This hides partial failures.

---

## FINAL REPORT FORMAT

After completing bot creation, always provide:

```
📊 BOT REPORT: [Project Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project ID: [uuid]

✅ Flows Created:
  1. [flow_name] (id: [uuid]) — [N] answers — [type summary]
  2. ...

⚠️ Issues Fixed:
  • [description of any issues encountered and resolved]

🔍 Validation: [PASS/FAIL]
  • Criticals: 0
  • Warnings: [N]

📤 Deploy Status: [DEPLOYED / NOT YET / READY_TO_SCAN]

🔗 Tool Call Trace:
  [list of all tool calls made in order]
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Never Do These)

1. ❌ Creating a flow without immediately adding answers
2. ❌ Reporting success without verification (`list_*`)
3. ❌ Deleting without showing impact and getting confirmation
4. ❌ Deploying without running `validate_bot` first
5. ❌ Mixing `add_chatpdf` and `add_text` in the same flow
6. ❌ Setting `listenKeywords: true` on non-VOICE_NOTE flows
7. ❌ Setting `capture: true` on the last answer of a flow
8. ❌ Batch-creating all flows before adding answers
9. ❌ Ignoring validation warnings about message length (>160 chars)
10. ❌ Creating `add_http` answers without `plugins.http.rules: []`
